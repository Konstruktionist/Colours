NAMING CONVENTIONS      *group-name* *{group-name}* *E669* *W18*

A syntax group name is to be used for syntax items that match the same kind of
thing.  These are then linked to a highlight group that specifies the color.
A syntax group name doesn't specify any color or attributes itself.

The name for a highlight or syntax group must consist of ASCII letters, digits
and the underscore.  As a regexp: "[a-zA-Z0-9_]*"

To be able to allow each user to pick his favorite set of colors, there must
be preferred names for highlight groups that are common for many languages.
These are the suggested group names (if syntax highlighting works properly
you can see the actual color, except for "Ignore"):

	*Comment				any comment

	*Constant			any constant
	 String				a string constant: "this is a string"
    Character			a character constant: 'c', '\n'
	 Number				a number constant: 234, 0xff
    Boolean				a boolean constant: TRUE, false
	 Float				a floating point constant: 2.3e10

	*Identifier			any variable name
	 Function			function name (also: methods for classes)

	*Statement			any statement
	 Conditional			if, then, else, endif, switch, etc.
    Repeat				for, do, while, etc.
	 Label				case, default, etc.
    Operator			"sizeof", "+", "*", etc.
    Keyword				any other keyword
	 Exception			try, catch, throw

	*PreProc				generic Preprocessor
	 Include				preprocessor #include
    Define				preprocessor #define
	 Macro				same as Define
    PreCondit			preprocessor #if, #else, #endif, etc.

	*Type					int, long, char, etc.
	 StorageClass		static, register, volatile, etc.
    Structure			struct, union, enum, etc.
	 Typedef				A typedef

	*Special				any special symbol
	 SpecialChar		special character in a constant
    Tag					you can use CTRL-] on this
	 Delimiter			character that needs attention
    SpecialComment	special things inside a comment
	 Debug				debugging statements

	*Underlined			text that stands out, HTML links

	*Ignore				left blank, hidden  |hl-Ignore|

	*Error				any erroneous construct

	*Todo					anything that needs extra attention; mostly the
							keywords TODO FIXME and XXX

The names marked with * are the preferred groups; the others are minor groups.
For the preferred groups, the "syntax.vim" file contains default highlighting.
The minor groups are linked to the preferred groups, so they get the same
highlighting.  You can override these defaults by using ":highlight" commands
after sourcing the "syntax.vim" file.

Note that highlight group names are not case sensitive.  "String" and "string"
can be used for the same group.

The following names are reserved and cannot be used as a group name:
	NONE   ALL   ALLBUT   contains   contained
