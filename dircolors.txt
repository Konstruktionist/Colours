LSCOLORS   The value of this variable describes what color to use
           for which attribute when colors are enabled with
           CLICOLOR.	This string is a concatenation of pairs of the
           format fb, where f is the foreground color and b is the
           background color.

           The color designators are as follows:

           a  black
           b  red
           c  green
           d  brown
           e  blue
           f  magenta
           g  cyan
           h  light grey
           A  bold black, usually shows up as dark grey
           B  bold red
           C  bold green
           D  bold brown, usually shows up as yellow
           E  bold blue
           F  bold magenta
           G  bold cyan
           H  bold light grey; looks like bright white
           x  default foreground or background

             Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.  The actual
             display may differ depending on the color capabilities of
             the terminal in use.

             The order of the attributes are as follows:

          1.	directory
          2.	symbolic link
          3.	socket
          4.	pipe
          5.	executable
          6.	block special
          7.	character special
          8.	executable with setuid bit set
          9.	executable with setgid bit set
          10.	directory writable to others, with sticky bit
          11.	directory writable to others, without sticky bit


The default is "exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad"
    ex fx cx dx bx eg ed ab ag ac ad
